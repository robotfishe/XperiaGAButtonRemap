This is a very simple module that replaces a vendor keylayout file to make it easier to remap the Google Assistant button on the Xperia 1 III. Once this module is installed, the system will receive the PROG_BLUE keycode instead of ASSIST when the button is pressed. The PROG_BLUE keycode can in turn be mapped to any action using a solution like Xposed Edge without any interference from the Assistant listener.
